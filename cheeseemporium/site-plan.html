      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the website is to educate users on all the different kinds of cheeses and their respecitve wheeled form. 
        Furthermore, the purpose of the website is to have easily accessible information about cheese and cheese wheels. Another purpose 
        of the website is to help useres make an educated and informed decision on what cheese to purchase on their next grocery store 
        trip in order to have the highest of satisfaction. The final purpose of the site is to increase awareness of the possible cheese 
        selections the average person may want to endure on and to also help people on a budget find quality cheese at a reasonable price.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience of Cheese Emporium are people who are interested in quality and fine cheese and cheese wheel information.
        This would put our audience in the age demographic of middle-aged to senior citizen, because our audience would have to be 
        old enough in order to make purhcases and make sensible and educated decisions. Their needs that aren't being met would be the 
        lack of information of good cheese and cheese wheels in a easily accesible central repository of information. Our audience will 
        more often than not access our information on a desktop computer or laptop, but we do expect our users will also view our website
        on their mobile devices often.</p>  <!-- change this -->
