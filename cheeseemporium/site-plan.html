      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the website is to educate users on all the different kinds of cheeses and their respecitve wheeled form. 
        Furthermore, the purpose of the website is to have easily accessible information about cheese and cheese wheels. Another purpose 
        of the website is to help useres make an educated and informed decision on what cheese to purchase on their next grocery store 
        trip in order to have the highest of satisfaction. The final purpose of the site is to increase awareness of the possible cheese 
        selections the average person may want to endure on and to also help people on a budget find quality cheese at a reasonable price.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience of Cheese Emporium are people who are interested in quality and fine cheese and cheese wheel information.
        This would put our audience in the age demographic of middle-aged to senior citizen, because our audience would have to be 
        old enough in order to make purhcases and make sensible and educated decisions. Their needs that aren't being met would be the 
        lack of information of good cheese and cheese wheels in a easily accesible central repository of information. Our audience will 
        more often than not access our information on a desktop computer or laptop, but we do expect our users will also view our website
        on their mobile devices often.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Cheese, the single greatest food ever conceived on the earth. You can never have too much cheese (well maybe you can), it 
        enhances, enables, and promotes great flavors in a variety of foods. It is the great enabler that helps make certain foods 
        possible: ravioli, mac n’ cheese, pizza, and of course, cheesecake. All these foods would not be possible without cheese. 
        You might think to yourself, “There is no way there is anything better than cheese!” However, you’d be mistaken and deceived. 
        For there is something better than cheese itself, it is not blasphemous, but it is by nature. Cheese wheels are the vastly 
        superior form of all cheese, not only are these perfect flat cylindrical forms of cheese tasty, but they look tremendously 
        divine as well. These wheels of cheese are only the finest delicacies in the modern world, raking in at sky-scraping values.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what is a cheese wheel, what makes it so high and great? A cheese wheel is a cylindrical wheel of cheese where it is 
        typical for the height of the cheese to be longer than it is wide. This gives it a “barrel” shape and is sometimes referred 
        to as a truckle of cheese. These wheels can last over twenty-five years when kept under the perfect conditions. The most 
        expensive of cheese wheels is Pule, or “Donkey Cheese”, which is only produced by one farm in the whole wide world, and 
        rakes in over $600 a pound. But most people won’t be able to afford this high-quality cheese, but there are multiple 
        different kinds of cheese that the average person can solemnly enjoy.

      <h3>How it's made</h3>
      <p>
        Cheese wheel making is a very intricate and delicate process that is very fruitful in returns. Cheese is one of the most 
        unique foods in the world, you can make such fine and delicious cheese from only a handful of ingredients. You can 
        transform milk using such little amount of ingredients such as: rennet and salt. Just give it the right temperature and 
        time and you got yourself some cheese from almost nothing. But one of the core ingredients of cheese is milk. The milk 
        used for cheese doesn’t only come from cows (like most people suspect), it can also come from goats, sheep, buffalo, 
        horses, yaks, and even donkeys. The higher quality the milk the better, not only will the cheese come out better, but 
        it will also perform better in each stage of the cheese wheel’s life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The first stage of the cheese wheel’s life begins with heating up the milk to a temperature where the lactic acid bacteria 
        can thrive inside of the milk (but don’t worry harmful bacteria’s growth is inhibited during this stage of development). 
        The next stage is to separate the solids (curds) from the liquids by using rennet which comes from the stomach lining of 
        animals. The next steps are all up to the recipe that the cheesemaker is using. Some recipes may require salting and 
        applying more heating on the curds in order to drive out the moisture. The cheese at this stage begins to be morphed 
        into the desired shape of a wheel. After this stage, depending on the cheese there are multiple outcomes that can occur 
        such as being consumed or remaining brined. But most of the cheese are stored and kept in certain conditions for them to 
        age to perfection. Aging the cheese is where all the flavors and textures of the cheese wheels occur. Ages can take from 
        a few weeks to age up to over eighteen years. Cheese wheel making is not a process that can be rushed, it takes time, and 
        sometimes it takes a lot of time in order to get the utmost perfect delectable, sumptuous cheese wheel.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Many historians believe that cheesemaking began over seven-thousand years ago but there is not enough evidence where it 
        originated or when it was first made/discovered. One of the most common ways to make cheeses is by using rennet, and it 
        is theorized by historians that ancient people would put milk into animal stomachs (which is where rennet is found) and 
        that would cause the milk to curl and turn into cheese, however this is just a theory. But by the Roman times, cheesemaking 
        had become common practiced and even became a major food group, signifying its importance in this world. Many of today’s 
        most popular cheeses were cataloged during the Middle Ages. Some examples are that Cheddar was discovered in the 1100s 
        and Parmesan was discovered in 1597. Some of our most popular cheeses we consume today are almost one-thousand years old. 
        In reports by conquistadors there were accounts of the Incas making and consuming llama cheese. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The first cheesemaking factory was founded in Switzerland in 1815, however it wasn’t until after factories moving to an 
        assembly-line creation method, but in the United States. Jesse Williams a dairy farmer from Rome, New York created an 
        assembly-line like factory in order to produce cheese wheels more efficiently. Within the following decades of Jesse 
        Williams’s successes, did hundreds of cheesemaking facilities were produced. Cheese wheel making has come a long way from 
        being accidentally created, to being made by hand, then to being made on an assembly line. Cheese is a story of a 
        delectable and delicious food being enjoyed and cherished by millions around the world.
