                <h1>The Genesis of cheese</h1>
                <p>Cheese wheel making is a very intricate and delicate process that is very fruitful in returns. Cheese is one of the 
                    most unique foods in the world, you can make such fine and delicious cheese from only a handful of ingredients. 
                    You can transform milk using such little amount of ingredients such as: rennet and salt. Just give it the right 
                    temperature and time and you got yourself some cheese from almost nothing. But one of the core ingredients of 
                    cheese is milk. The milk used for cheese doesn't only come from cows (like most people suspect), it can also come 
                    from goats, sheep, buffalo, horses, yaks, and even donkeys. The higher quality the milk the better, not only will 
                    the cheese come out better, but it will also perform better in each stage of the cheese wheel's life.</p>

                <h1>The fine art of aging</h1>
                <p>The first stage of the cheese wheel's life begins with heating up the milk to a temperature where the lactic acid 
                    bacteria can thrive inside of the milk (but don't worry harmful bacteria's growth is inhibited during this 
                    stage of development). The next stage is to separate the solids (curds) from the liquids by using rennet which 
                    comes from the stomach lining of animals. The next steps are all up to the recipe that the cheesemaker is using. 
                    Some recipes may require salting and applying more heating on the curds in order to drive out the moisture. 
                    The cheese at this stage begins to be morphed into the desired shape of a wheel. After this stage, depending 
                    on the cheese there are multiple outcomes that can occur such as being consumed or remaining brined. But most 
                    of the cheese are stored and kept in certain conditions for them to age to perfection. Aging the cheese is where 
                    all the flavors and textures of the cheese wheels occur. Ages can take from a few weeks to age up to over eighteen 
                    years. Cheese wheel making is not a process that can be rushed, it takes time, and sometimes it takes a lot of 
                    time in order to get the utmost perfect delectable, sumptuous cheese wheel.</p>
